Welcome to MERAKI
Alia Benitez's personal craft, hobby, and fandom space.

PICTURE?

INTRO?
"Meraki" (pronounced may-rah-key) originates in Greek, and when translated, means "essence of ourselves." Meraki implies putting your heart and soul into what you are doing, infusing it with an undivided attention, passion, and creative touch that makes your work unique.

This special attention is something I give to everything I love: my art and my writing; my favorite games and literature; and more. But what I would love even more is to share the things I love, with YOU.

Once again, Welcome to MERAKI.
