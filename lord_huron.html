Lord Huron

PINE WOODS PICTURE/BANNER HERE?

START OF A JOURNEY (head2)
I discovered this band by total coincidence. I was fourteen at the time, developing some of my earliest creative writing - a world based on an animated concept I'd seen on YouTube within the last week - and I was listening to music for inspiration. Music heavily informed my writing back then, and still does to this day; it helps me paint world locations within my mind's eye, shapes the lives and perspectives of my characters, and accompanies plot events both big and small. But something about this brainstorm session just wasn't going right, so I found myself listening more to music on YouTube rather than writing anything. And I remember being frustrated, but kind of okay with it. I was open-minded to putting the writing away and finding new music instead. There would always be time; the more music I had, the more material I'd have to gain inspiration from, right?

Then, YouTube recommended me "Meet Me In The Woods" by Lord Huron, and my life was forever changed.

RECENT BAND PICTURE HERE WITH CAPTION?

Lord Huron was founded by Michigan native Ben Schneider. At the time of the project's genesis, Schneider was writing music solo by the shoreline of Lake Huron, deriving inspiration from the natural world and his childhood memories of the area. At the encouragement of family and friends, Schneider released two EPs, <i>Into the Sun</i> and <i>Mighty</i>, at a music festival in 2010. It was only after the success and interest garnered at this festival that Schneider reached out to his friend Mark Barry about formally starting a band.

As of 2025, Lord Huron is a successful indie rock/folk band consisting of: (list here)
    <ul>
        <li>Ben Schneider, lead vocals/guitar</li>
        <li>Mark Barry, percussion/vocals</li>
        <li>Miguel Brise√±o, bass/keyboard/theremin/percussion</li>
        <li>Tom Renaud, guitar/vocals</li>
        <li>Supporting musicians Misty Boyce and Brandon Walters</li>
    </ul>
Their second-most recent album, <i>Long Lost</i> (2021) attained #1 on US Folk Albums, #2 on US Top Alternative Albums, and #3 on US Top Rock Albums (Billboard); and reached #23 on the US Billboard 200 list. The immersive blend of music, visual arts, writing, digital media/film, and acting that was foundational to Schneider's work before Lord Huron are now a staple of the band's work. Each of their albums evoke introspection and take listeners on a journey, with broad and interconnected story arcs that - according to an exclusive 2015 interview with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/exclusive-read-the-first-four-pages-of-lord-hurons-comic-book-strange-trails/" Vice </a> - Schneider "intended to be fragmentary, non-chronological and in some ways confounding;" serving as built-in opportunities for fans to interpret the music, lyrics, and thematic story-telling in their own ways. But each does so with a unique spin that I've come to love, and so below, I will briefly share what I love about each album from Lord Huron's discography and how I've interpreted them.

A BELOVED DISCOGRAPHY
[pictures of album cover accompanying each section here...]
LONESOME DREAMS 2012
    As Lord Huron's debut album, this 51 minute tracklist appears to be a story both independent of and deeply inspired by Schneider's memories and experiences on Lake Huron. The first song, "Ends of the Earth," is an evocative call-to-action, an introduction to the musical world that the album aims to share; embodying Schneider's hopes that listeners will continue to listen, follow this project through to the end, and make both his and their unrealized dreams into reality. It also instills a sense of mission and brotherhood within me, quietly rallying me for a journey that Lord Huron wants us to see through together. The song "Brother," which sits at the tail end of the album, reinforces these feelings, building upon a declarations of trust and loyalty that remain unwavering amid lyrical doubts and hardships.
    However, the album is rich with so much more. Among the themes of beginning and ending a journey, reminiscing on love, demonstrating trust and faith in brotherhood, and reckoning with the consequences of one's actions, my favorite song from <i>Lonesome Dreams</i> is "The Ghost on the Shore." This song is exceptionally haunting, filling my mind's eye with visions of a shimmering figure on the shores of Lake Huron. The harmonica that echoes throughout the song reminds me of ships passing forlornly through fog... Or of a funeral dirge whistling along the wind, tracing the footsteps this person made in life and the emptiness they left after their death. But more than anything, this song is a tribute to a place that holds memories; the home where your heart and soul is, no matter how far you wander or where you end up on this earth. It's wanting to return, even if you cannot stay. This song is growth and loss, travel and returning home, remembrance and bittersweet mourning all at once; and it is the song I always come back to when I need to center myself among my own lonesome dreams.

STRANGE TRAILS 2015
    Despite the forest trails emblazoned on its cover, <i>Strange Trails</i> adopts a cowboy-desert-western energy that I struggle to explain, but have loved since I discovered the band leading up to its release. With a nearly 56 minute runtime and "14 Songs from the Unknown" in its tracklist, the album jumps between yearning expressions of love, macabre visions of apocalypse and darkness, thrills borne from taking risks and vengeful emotions, and belonging to the earth in life and in death. It walks the line between supernatural and real, hauntingly ethereal yet grounded in the human experience... What's magical to me is that I pick up on something new with every re-listen. It's like a nuanced book with details that just keep on giving.
    Although <i>Strange Trails</i> has a special place in my heart, with many of my favorite Lord Huron songs originating from its tracklist, my number one favorite song from this album is probably "Frozen Pines". According to Schneider, this song is from the perspective of "a young girl named Danielle" who is searching the woods for a friend of hers that disappeared, desiring nothing more than to be with her friend again. The cover art for the single associates the song with UFO imagery, but to me, the song is less mystical than the cover suggests. It sings to me of a death in nature - perhaps a hiking tragedy - that claimed one friend and now consumes the life of the other. There is a heart-wrenching sense of mourning and loyalty that haunts this song, navigating grief and an endless search that enshrouds you like a forest, but pushes you to keep going, if only to finally reach your missing friend in whatever life awaits you now or after death. The somber yet steadfast devotion encapsulated by this song truly has a chokehold on my heart, and it's one that I will ruminate on for all of my days.

VIDE NOIR 2018
    Out of all the Lord Huron albums that have been released so far, none of them have quite replicated the sound and energy exuded by this one, neither before nor since. Aptly categorized as a "rock" and "psychedelic" album, this 49 minute experience delves into topics such as drug abuse, the fleetingness of time (and how easy it is to get lost in its flow), love gone wrong, mortality, and - my favorite - the breadth of difference between a fate you accept and a fate you choose to escape, defy, or make your own.
    My favorite song on this album is a two-parter called "Ancient Names I and II". The first part tells a pretty straightforward story about a man who goes to a fortune-teller to have his fortune read, but she reveals that his life hangs in the balance; as her crystal ball's vision shows that he's tied up in a dark prophecy or curse that begets a horrible fate. Where it gets interesting for me is that it's unclear whether his fate is to be wrought by someone else, such as a supernatural force or a spurned lover, or whether it's self-inflicted. All that's known for sure is that he's doomed to darkness by a "fallen star," that he "will never see the golden sunrise," and that he denies his own death; choosing instead to run away from an unnamed "her" for as long as possible.
    Is this "her" the fortune teller? Is it a spurned lover? Is it Death herself? It's left open-ended, and I think that's <em>fascinating</em>>.
    The second part of Ancient Names is a one-of-a-kind experience that I'd best describe as listening to someone rising from the throes of their misery and running, not out of cowardice or denial, but in defiance of their fate. But it could also be interpreted as the main character running toward their fate, accepting full knowledge of what will happen to them and pursuing his dreams, goals, and vices regardless of the consequences. The lyrics are explicit in his defiance and resolution, no matter what perspective one adopts on the matter:
        <blockquote>I scream and shout like this
        Just to prove to the world that I still exist
        I don't believe in life
        And I won't believe in death 'til I die.</blockquote>
    The instrumentals that back the entirety of Part II are <strong>powerful</strong>. I love that the drums and guitar work together to get the heart pumping, adrenaline running through your veins as you consider both the power the man claims from making his defiant choices, and his fear of facing consequences for them. There is an ethereal beat that starts at the end of Part I and repeats throughout Part II (I think they're played via keyboard or some kind of synthesizer) that is just reality-bending in all sense of the word. And the quote above! <strong>GOODNESS!</strong> He exists whether the forces that be like it or not, and he's going to live the way he sees fit until he's finally struck down. That sort of mindset, while it has some unhealthy tendencies to it, is so enticingly empowering that I'm continually brought back to listen to those lyrics again and again. I highly recommend giving it (and the whole album) a listen. It's unlike anything else I've ever heard, in the best way possible.

LONG LOST 2021
    Although this album appears to have been the most well-received Lord Huron album of all, <i>Long Lost</i> took the longest to grow on me. I appreciated that Schneider and his band decided to change things up with this 58 minute long tracklist, spacing out the songs with interludes voiced by Tubbs Tarbell, a character they developed as a radio host for the Whispering Pines Radio Station in their world lore. They also released full-length episodes on YouTube that were chock-full of references to the stories Lord Huron have collectively developed over the past decade, as well as never-before seen covers of some of their best songs. However, after the thrills of <i>Vide Noir</i>, I struggled to adjust to the mostly folksy, country sound of this release. Not to say that I didn't love it, it just took me some time to get acclimate and find the meaning in the lyrics and sounds.
    A sentiment that echoes across this album, as well as the episodic content, is [french]"Puis-tu vivre jusqu'√† ta mort," which translates in English to "May you live until you die." It is a wish from one character unto another, a hope that they live a long, healthy, and fulfilling life that is full of experiences and memories. This sentiment is juxtaposed with each of the album's other songs, shining light on the different ways it may mean to live a full life and the ephemeral relationship between time and memory. The album's titular song, "Long Lost," adopts the perspective of a character who has found peace and happiness for themselves by 'being lost' in the wilderness, "running through the forest / dancing in the fields like this forever." The song "Love Me Like You Used To"

THE COSMIC SELECTOR, VOL. 1 2025
    Given that this album just came out on July 18th, 2025, I have not yet had time to compile my analyses of its lyrics and different thematic elements. So instead, I'll share my first thoughts and impressions with you.
    To me, this 49 minute-long album sounds like a culmination of the gentle dreaminess of <i>Lonesome Dreams</i>, the agency against fate explored in <i>Vide Noir</i>, and the 'unmoored from Time' sensations of <i>Long Lost</i>. This blend is immediately discernible as the album starts, as the music, lyrics, and visuals accompanying the first track, "Looking Back," are akin to looking back on old photos and memories while you drink the night away. Certain people, events, and places are crystal clear, while others are corrupted or blurred away by the passage of time. In constrast, "Who Laughs Last (feat. Kristen Stewart)" possesses a manic bass guitar riff and drumbeats that harken back to the hooks and motifs utilized in <i>Vide Noir</i>'s "Ancient Names I and II." The supernatural, alien, and otherworldly aspects explored in <i>Vide Noir</i> and <i>Strange Trails</i> are also referenced in this song, especially in the YouTube music video release - one of my favorite details about that video is that at around 1:47, there is a visual of lightning that appears to stalk across the earth like a predatory animal. I remember not being certain how I felt about listening to Kristen Stewart speaking throughout the song, but I gasped so loud when I saw that animalistic phenomenon in the storm. It was a humbling reminder that my preconceptions of Lord Huron's music could not (and should not) sway how I come to enjoy any of their new songs and artistic visions. I think I can safely say I love and appreciate that song, now.
    I think my favorite song on this album so far has been "Is There Anybody Out There."
